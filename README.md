This is our first project. Our goal is to create an application that allows users to search a cuisine of their choice which would give them options of restaurants near their location. Alternatively, if the user would prefer to make a specific meal themselves and/or if they do not have a restaurant near them that serves their desired cuisine they can also search for a recipe.


Objective 1:

Create a home page where users can choose if they would like to search for a restaurant near them or find a recipe.

Objective 2:

Create submit form for restaurants where users can enter a cuisine they would like to try based on their current location.
If the user would rather cook something at home, they can look up their recipe of choice.

Objective 3:

The search results of the restaurants near the user will be displayed along with a brief description of the restaurant such as the name, location, contact info and a link that the user can click on which takes them to the restaurant's website.

The search result of the recipes will give a few different recipe options to the user and will display the ingredients needed for the recipe and a link to a website that will give the user more detailed instructions on how to create the recipe.
